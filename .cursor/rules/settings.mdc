Use functional React components.

Think about the data structure first, then write the code.

Always use 'use client' only where necessary. I'm building [App Name]—it's [Brief Description of What It Does]."

**General Guidelines:**
- Write concise, readable, and production-ready code.
- Use TypeScript for all components and utility functions. Prefer interfaces over types.
- Use functional components with hooks.
- Avoid class components.
- Modularize code: break down large components into smaller, reusable parts.

**Styling (Tailwind CSS):**
- Use Tailwind CSS for all styling.
- Use mobile-first responsive design approaches (e.g., `flex-col md:flex-row`).
- Utilize the `cn` utility (clsx + tailwind-merge) for conditional class names and merging custom classes.
- Avoid arbitrary values (e.g., `h-[50px]`) if standard utility classes can achieve the result.
- Keep HTML structure semantic.

**UI Components (shadcn/ui):**
- Always check if a component exists in `@/components/ui` before creating a custom one.
- When using shadcn components, import them directly (e.g., `import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"`).
- Customize shadcn components via props or the `className` prop using the `cn` utility, rather than rewriting the component source code unless necessary.
- Use Lucide React for icons (standard with shadcn).

**Animation (Framer Motion):**
- Use `framer-motion` for complex animations and transitions.
- Prefer declarative animations using the `variants` prop for cleaner JSX.
- Use `<AnimatePresence>` for exit animations when components unmount.
- Ensure animations are performant: prefer animating `transform` and `opacity`.
- Do not overuse animations; keep interactions snappy and professional.

**Code Structure & Naming:**
- Component names: PascalCase (e.g., `ProductCard.tsx`).
- Helper functions: camelCase.
- File structure: Group related components or colocate them with their features if the project scales.

**Example of desired component structure:**

```tsx
import { motion } from "framer-motion";
import { cn } from "@/lib/utils";
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";

interface MyComponentProps {
  isActive: boolean;
  className?: string;
}

export const MyComponent = ({ isActive, className }: MyComponentProps) => {
  return (
    <motion.div
      initial={{ opacity: 0, y: 10 }}
      animate={{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }}
      className={cn("p-4 border rounded-lg", className)}
    >
      <h2 className="text-xl font-bold mb-2">Title</h2>
      <Button variant={isActive ? "default" : "outline"}>
        Click Me
      </Button>
    </motion.div>
  );
};
