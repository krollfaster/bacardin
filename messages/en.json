        "Ernest Shuldays worked in my team from October 2024 to October 2025 on the “POTOK” product. His responsibilities included tasks that directly impacted key business metrics.",
        "His main achievement was a full redesign of the “POTOK” interface. Based on strategic goals and research, Ernest completely refreshed the UI. As a result, CSI increased by 2 points and NPS by 6 pp; we also received positive feedback from key business stakeholders.",
        "His contribution to the bank’s OKR system deserves special mention: he conceptually developed goal cascading from top management to product teams. Later, he produced target design versions that incorporated project work principles and were approved by stakeholders."

        "Initiated and implemented a UI kit and aligned it with engineering, which significantly increased the release speed of new features.",

        "Clearly understood how his work affected product metrics and proposed solutions aligned with strategic decisions.",
        "Worked effectively under urgent tasks that were not planned for the sprint, quickly elaborating concepts and securing final stakeholder approval."

      "closing": "I confidently recommend Ernest Shuldays for Senior/Lead Product Designer roles, especially in teams where a strong focus on hypotheses, data, and business outcomes is critical."
